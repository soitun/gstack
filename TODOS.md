# TODOS

## Browse

### Bundle server.ts into compiled binary

**What:** Eliminate `resolveServerScript()` fallback chain entirely — bundle server.ts into the compiled browse binary.

**Why:** The current fallback chain (check adjacent to cli.ts, check global install) is fragile and caused bugs in v0.3.2. A single compiled binary is simpler and more reliable.

**Context:** Bun's `--compile` flag can bundle multiple entry points. The server is currently resolved at runtime via file path lookup. Bundling it removes the resolution step entirely.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Sessions (isolated browser instances)

**What:** Isolated browser instances with separate cookies/storage/history, addressable by name.

**Why:** Enables parallel testing of different user roles, A/B test verification, and clean auth state management.

**Context:** Requires Playwright browser context isolation. Each session gets its own context with independent cookies/localStorage. Prerequisite for video recording (clean context lifecycle) and auth vault.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3

### Video recording

**What:** Record browser interactions as video (start/stop controls).

**Why:** Video evidence in QA reports and PR bodies. Currently deferred because `recreateContext()` destroys page state.

**Context:** Needs sessions for clean context lifecycle. Playwright supports video recording per context. Also needs WebM → GIF conversion for PR embedding.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions

### v20 encryption format support

**What:** AES-256-GCM support for future Chromium cookie DB versions (currently v10).

**Why:** Future Chromium versions may change encryption format. Proactive support prevents breakage.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### State persistence

**What:** Save/load cookies + localStorage to JSON files for reproducible test sessions.

**Why:** Enables "resume where I left off" for QA sessions and repeatable auth states.

**Context:** The `saveState()`/`restoreState()` helpers from the handoff feature (browser-manager.ts) already capture cookies + localStorage + sessionStorage + URLs. Adding file I/O on top is ~20 lines.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions

### Auth vault

**What:** Encrypted credential storage, referenced by name. LLM never sees passwords.

**Why:** Security — currently auth credentials flow through the LLM context. Vault keeps secrets out of the AI's view.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions, state persistence

### Iframe support

**What:** `frame <sel>` and `frame main` commands for cross-frame interaction.

**Why:** Many web apps use iframes (embeds, payment forms, ads). Currently invisible to browse.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Semantic locators

**What:** `find role/label/text/placeholder/testid` with attached actions.

**Why:** More resilient element selection than CSS selectors or ref numbers.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Device emulation presets

**What:** `set device "iPhone 16 Pro"` for mobile/tablet testing.

**Why:** Responsive layout testing without manual viewport resizing.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Network mocking/routing

**What:** Intercept, block, and mock network requests.

**Why:** Test error states, loading states, and offline behavior.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Download handling

**What:** Click-to-download with path control.

**Why:** Test file download flows end-to-end.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Content safety

**What:** `--max-output` truncation, `--allowed-domains` filtering.

**Why:** Prevent context window overflow and restrict navigation to safe domains.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Streaming (WebSocket live preview)

**What:** WebSocket-based live preview for pair browsing sessions.

**Why:** Enables real-time collaboration — human watches AI browse.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4

### CDP mode

**What:** Connect to already-running Chrome/Electron apps via Chrome DevTools Protocol.

**Why:** Test production apps, Electron apps, and existing browser sessions without launching new instances.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Linux/Windows cookie decryption

**What:** GNOME Keyring / kwallet / DPAPI support for non-macOS cookie import.

**Why:** Cross-platform cookie import. Currently macOS-only (Keychain).

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4

## Ship

### Ship log — persistent record of /ship runs

**What:** Append structured JSON entry to `.gstack/ship-log.json` at end of every /ship run (version, date, branch, PR URL, review findings, Greptile stats, todos completed, test results).

**Why:** /retro has no structured data about shipping velocity. Ship log enables: PRs-per-week trending, review finding rates, Greptile signal over time, test suite growth.

**Context:** /retro already reads greptile-history.md — same pattern. Eval persistence (eval-store.ts) shows the JSON append pattern exists in the codebase. ~15 lines in ship template.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Post-deploy verification (ship + browse)

**What:** After push, browse staging/preview URL, screenshot key pages, check console for JS errors, compare staging vs prod via snapshot diff. Include verification screenshots in PR body. STOP if critical errors found.

**Why:** Catch deployment-time regressions (JS errors, broken layouts) before merge.

**Context:** Requires S3 upload infrastructure for PR screenshots. Pairs with visual PR annotations.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload, visual PR annotations

### Visual verification with screenshots in PR body

**What:** /ship Step 7.5: screenshot key pages after push, embed in PR body.

**Why:** Visual evidence in PRs. Reviewers see what changed without deploying locally.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## Review

### Inline PR annotations

**What:** /ship and /review post inline review comments at specific file:line locations using `gh api` to create pull request review comments.

**Why:** Line-level annotations are more actionable than top-level comments. The PR thread becomes a line-by-line conversation between Greptile, Claude, and human reviewers.

**Context:** GitHub supports inline review comments via `gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews`. Pairs naturally with Phase 3.6 visual annotations.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Greptile training feedback export

**What:** Aggregate greptile-history.md into machine-readable JSON summary of false positive patterns, exportable to the Greptile team for model improvement.

**Why:** Closes the feedback loop — Greptile can use FP data to stop making the same mistakes on your codebase.

**Context:** Was a P3 Future Idea. Upgraded to P2 now that greptile-history.md data infrastructure exists. The signal data is already being collected; this just makes it exportable. ~40 lines.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Enough FP data accumulated (10+ entries)

### Visual review with annotated screenshots

**What:** /review Step 4.5: browse PR's preview deploy, annotated screenshots of changed pages, compare against production, check responsive layouts, verify accessibility tree.

**Why:** Visual diff catches layout regressions that code review misses.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## QA

### QA trend tracking

**What:** Compare baseline.json over time, detect regressions across QA runs.

**Why:** Spot quality trends — is the app getting better or worse?

**Context:** `eval:trend` now tracks test-level pass rates (eval infrastructure). QA-run-level trending (health scores over time across QA report files) is a separate feature that could reuse `computeTrends` pattern from `lib/cli-eval.ts`.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### CI/CD QA integration

**What:** `/qa` as GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops.

**Why:** Automated quality gate in CI. Catch regressions before merge.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### Smart default QA tier

**What:** After a few runs, check index.md for user's usual tier pick, skip the AskUserQuestion.

**Why:** Reduces friction for repeat users.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### Accessibility audit mode

**What:** `--a11y` flag for focused accessibility testing.

**Why:** Dedicated accessibility testing beyond the general QA checklist.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### CI/CD generation for non-GitHub providers

**What:** Extend CI/CD bootstrap to generate GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`), and Bitrise pipelines.

**Why:** Not all projects use GitHub Actions. Universal CI/CD bootstrap would make test bootstrap work for everyone.

**Context:** v1 ships with GitHub Actions only. Detection logic already checks for `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`, `bitrise.yml` and skips with an informational note. Each provider needs ~20 lines of template text in `generateTestBootstrap()`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Test bootstrap (shipped)

### Auto-upgrade weak tests (★) to strong tests (★★★)

**What:** When Step 3.4 coverage audit identifies existing ★-rated tests (smoke/trivial assertions), generate improved versions testing edge cases and error paths.

**Why:** Many codebases have tests that technically exist but don't catch real bugs — `expect(component).toBeDefined()` isn't testing behavior. Upgrading these closes the gap between "has tests" and "has good tests."

**Context:** Requires the quality scoring rubric from the test coverage audit. Modifying existing test files is riskier than creating new ones — needs careful diffing to ensure the upgraded test still passes. Consider creating a companion test file rather than modifying the original.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Test quality scoring (shipped)

## Retro

### Deployment health tracking (retro + browse)

**What:** Screenshot production state, check perf metrics (page load times), count console errors across key pages, track trends over retro window.

**Why:** Retro should include production health alongside code metrics.

**Context:** Requires browse integration. Screenshots + metrics fed into retro output.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Browse sessions

## Team Sync

### Streaming parser for large session files

**What:** Replace readFileSync with readline/createReadStream for session files >10MB.

**Why:** Currently skip files >10MB. Long sessions (1000+ turns, 35MB) lose enrichment data (tools_used, full turn count).

**Context:** Current 10MB cap is defensive. Session files at `~/.claude/projects/{hash}/{sid}.jsonl` can be 35MB for marathon sessions. Streaming parser removes the cap while keeping memory usage constant.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Transcript sync (Phase 3)

### Session effectiveness scoring

**What:** Compute a 1-5 effectiveness score per session based on turns to achieve goal, tool diversity, whether code was shipped, and session duration.

**Why:** Enables `show sessions --best` and team-level AI effectiveness metrics. Raw data (tools_used, turns, duration, summary) already in Supabase after transcript sync.

**Context:** Year 2 roadmap item. Scoring heuristics need iteration. Could start with: fewer turns = more efficient, more tool diversity = better problem decomposition, shipped code (detected via git) = successful outcome.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Transcript sync (Phase 3)

### ~~Weekly AI usage digest~~ ✓ Shipped in Phase 4

Implemented as `supabase/functions/weekly-digest/index.ts`. pg_cron Monday 9am UTC, aggregates 7-day team data, sends Slack summary.

## Team Dashboard

### Regression alert: include failing test names + dashboard link

**What:** Slack alert message should list the specific tests that regressed and include a direct URL to the dashboard Evals tab.

**Why:** Current alert says "pass rate dropped 89% → 82%" but doesn't say which tests. The person paged has to open the dashboard and hunt. Including test names and a direct link saves 2 minutes of triage.

**Context:** `all_results` array in eval_runs has per-test data. `formatSlackMessage()` in regression-alert/index.ts is the change point. Dashboard URL can be derived from SUPABASE_URL.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Phase 4 (shipped)

### Projected monthly cost annotation on dashboard

**What:** Add "Projected monthly: ~$X" annotation to the cost chart on the dashboard.

**Why:** Everyone wants the monthly number for budgeting. One line of math (last 4 weeks average × 4.33), huge value for finance conversations.

**Context:** `renderVBarChart` or `renderCosts` in dashboard/ui.ts. Data is already fetched.

**Effort:** XS
**Priority:** P3

### Ship notification to Slack

**What:** Post a Slack message when someone ships: "alice shipped v0.4.2 → repo-slug (PR #45)". Reuses existing Slack webhook from team_settings.

**Why:** Real-time team shipping awareness. Currently only regression alerts go to Slack — positive events (ships) should too.

**Context:** Either add to the sync push path in ship/SKILL.md.tmpl or create a new edge function triggered on ship_logs INSERT (same pattern as regression-alert).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Phase 4 (shipped)

### Dynamic favicon based on team pass rate

**What:** Dashboard favicon changes color (green/yellow/red dot) based on current overall eval pass rate. Visible from the browser tab bar without switching to the dashboard tab.

**Why:** Zero-click observability. At a glance from your tab bar, you know if the team is healthy.

**Context:** Canvas → data URL favicon, update on each fetchAll() refresh in dashboard/ui.ts. Green >80%, yellow 50-80%, red <50%.

**Effort:** XS
**Priority:** P3

### Server-side aggregation / materialized views

**What:** Replace client-side data fetching (6 parallel REST calls per refresh) with server-side pre-aggregated views or Supabase materialized views.

**Why:** Current approach pulls up to 100 rows per table per refresh. With 5+ users and 60s refresh, this puts pressure on Supabase request limits. Materialized views would return pre-computed summaries in a single call.

**Context:** Could use Supabase pg_cron to refresh materialized views every 5 minutes. Dashboard would fetch one view instead of 6 tables.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Phase 4 (shipped)

### Real-time SSE streaming on dashboard

**What:** Server-Sent Events stream from a Supabase edge function that pushes updates when new data arrives (eval_runs INSERT, ship_logs INSERT, heartbeats).

**Why:** Dashboard currently polls every 60s. SSE would make it truly real-time — see an eval complete the moment it finishes.

**Context:** Supabase Realtime can be used client-side, or a custom SSE edge function can listen to Postgres NOTIFY. Year 2 roadmap item.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3

### GitHub Check Run integration

**What:** When an eval run is pushed, create a GitHub Check Run on the corresponding commit/PR showing pass rate, regressions, and cost.

**Why:** Eval results become visible directly in the PR review workflow. Regressions can block merge.

**Context:** Requires GitHub App installation or personal access token. Uses GitHub REST API `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs`. Year 2 roadmap item.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Phase 4 (shipped)

### ship_logs index on (team_id, created_at)

**What:** Add composite index `idx_ship_logs_team_date ON ship_logs(team_id, created_at DESC)`.

**Why:** Weekly digest queries `ship_logs WHERE team_id = ? AND created_at >= ?`. Without this index, it table-scans. Low priority because ship_logs volume is small in Year 1, but needed before scale.

**Context:** Add to a new migration 008 or append to 007.

**Effort:** XS
**Priority:** P3

## Infrastructure

### ~~setup-gstack-upload~~ + ~~gstack-upload helper~~ — SUPERSEDED

Replaced by Supabase Storage (migration 008) + `bin/gstack-upload` + `lib/upload.ts`.
Screenshots upload to the team's Supabase Storage bucket with public CDN URLs.
No S3 needed.

### WebM to GIF conversion

**What:** ffmpeg-based WebM → GIF conversion for video evidence in PRs.

**Why:** GitHub PR bodies render GIFs but not WebM. Needed for video recording evidence.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Video recording

### Deploy-verify skill

**What:** Lightweight post-deploy smoke test: hit key URLs, verify 200s, screenshot critical pages, console error check, compare against baseline snapshots. Pass/fail with evidence.

**Why:** Fast post-deploy confidence check, separate from full QA.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### GitHub Actions eval upload

**What:** Run eval suite in CI, upload result JSON as artifact, post summary comment on PR.

**Why:** CI integration catches quality regressions before merge and provides persistent eval records per PR.

**Context:** Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI secrets. Cost is ~$4/run. Eval persistence system (v0.3.6) writes JSON to `~/.gstack-dev/evals/` — CI would upload as GitHub Actions artifacts and use `eval:compare` to post delta comment.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Eval persistence (shipped in v0.3.6)

### E2E model pinning

**What:** Pin E2E tests to claude-sonnet-4-6 for cost efficiency, add retry:2 for flaky LLM responses.

**Why:** Reduce E2E test cost and flakiness.

**Status:** Model pinning shipped (session-runner.ts passes `--model` from `EVAL_TIER` env). Retry:2 still TODO.

**Effort:** XS
**Priority:** P2

### Eval web dashboard

**What:** `bun run eval:dashboard` serves local HTML with charts: cost trending, detection rate, pass/fail history.

**Why:** Visual charts better for spotting trends than CLI tools.

**Context:** Reads `~/.gstack-dev/evals/*.json`. ~200 lines HTML + chart.js via Bun HTTP server.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Eval persistence (shipped in v0.3.6)

### CI/CD QA quality gate

**What:** Run `/qa` as a GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops below threshold.

**Why:** Automated quality gate catches regressions before merge. Currently QA is manual — CI integration makes it part of the standard workflow.

**Context:** Requires headless browse binary available in CI. The `/qa` skill already produces `baseline.json` with health scores — CI step would compare against the main branch baseline and fail if score drops. Would need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI secrets since `/qa` uses Claude.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Cross-platform URL open helper

**What:** `gstack-open-url` helper script — detect platform, use `open` (macOS) or `xdg-open` (Linux).

**Why:** The first-time Completeness Principle intro uses macOS `open` to launch the essay. If gstack ever supports Linux, this silently fails.

**Effort:** S (human: ~30 min / CC: ~2 min)
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** Nothing

### CDP-based DOM mutation detection for ref staleness

**What:** Use Chrome DevTools Protocol `DOM.documentUpdated` / MutationObserver events to proactively invalidate stale refs when the DOM changes, without requiring an explicit `snapshot` call.

**Why:** Current ref staleness detection (async count() check) only catches stale refs at action time. CDP mutation detection would proactively warn when refs become stale, preventing the 5-second timeout entirely for SPA re-renders.

**Context:** Parts 1+2 of ref staleness fix (RefEntry metadata + eager validation via count()) are shipped. This is Part 3 — the most ambitious piece. Requires CDP session alongside Playwright, MutationObserver bridge, and careful performance tuning to avoid overhead on every DOM change.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Ref staleness Parts 1+2 (shipped)

## Office Hours / Design

### Design docs → Supabase team store sync

**What:** Add design docs (`*-design-*.md`) to the Supabase sync pipeline alongside test plans, retro snapshots, and QA reports.

**Why:** Cross-team design discovery at scale. Local `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/` keyword-grep discovery works for same-machine users now, but Supabase sync makes it work across the whole team. Duplicate ideas surface, everyone sees what's been explored.

**Context:** /office-hours writes design docs to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/`. The team store already syncs test plans, retro snapshots, QA reports. Design docs follow the same pattern — just add a sync adapter.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** `garrytan/team-supabase-store` branch landing on main

### /yc-prep skill

**What:** Skill that helps founders prepare their YC application after /office-hours identifies strong signal. Pulls from the design doc, structures answers to YC app questions, runs a mock interview.

**Why:** Closes the loop. /office-hours identifies the founder, /yc-prep helps them apply well. The design doc already contains most of the raw material for a YC application.

**Effort:** M (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** office-hours founder discovery engine shipping first

## Design Review

### /plan-design-review + /qa-design-review + /design-consultation — SHIPPED

Shipped as v0.5.0 on main. Includes `/plan-design-review` (report-only design audit), `/qa-design-review` (audit + fix loop), and `/design-consultation` (interactive DESIGN.md creation). `{{DESIGN_METHODOLOGY}}` resolver provides shared 80-item design audit checklist.

## Document-Release

### Auto-invoke /document-release from /ship — SHIPPED

Shipped in v0.8.3. Step 8.5 added to `/ship` — after creating the PR, `/ship` automatically reads `document-release/SKILL.md` and executes the doc update workflow. Zero-friction doc updates.

### `{{DOC_VOICE}}` shared resolver

**What:** Create a placeholder resolver in gen-skill-docs.ts encoding the gstack voice guide (friendly, user-forward, lead with benefits). Inject into /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5, and reference from CLAUDE.md.

**Why:** DRY — voice rules currently live inline in 3 places (CLAUDE.md CHANGELOG style section, /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5). When the voice evolves, all three drift.

**Context:** Same pattern as `{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` — shared block injected into multiple templates to prevent drift. ~20 lines in gen-skill-docs.ts.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Ship Confidence Dashboard

### Smart review relevance detection — PARTIALLY SHIPPED

~~**What:** Auto-detect which of the 4 reviews are relevant based on branch changes (skip Design Review if no CSS/view changes, skip Code Review if plan-only).~~

`bin/gstack-diff-scope` shipped — categorizes diff into SCOPE_FRONTEND, SCOPE_BACKEND, SCOPE_PROMPTS, SCOPE_TESTS, SCOPE_DOCS, SCOPE_CONFIG. Used by design-review-lite to skip when no frontend files changed. Dashboard integration for conditional row display is a follow-up.

**Remaining:** Dashboard conditional row display (hide "Design Review: NOT YET RUN" when SCOPE_FRONTEND=false). Extend to Eng Review (skip for docs-only) and CEO Review (skip for config-only).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** gstack-diff-scope (shipped)

### /merge skill — review-gated PR merge

**What:** Create a `/merge` skill that merges an approved PR, but first checks the Review Readiness Dashboard and runs `/review` (Fix-First) if code review hasn't been done. Separates "ship" (create PR) from "merge" (land it).

**Why:** Currently `/review` runs inside `/ship` Step 3.5 but isn't tracked as a gate. A `/merge` skill ensures code review always happens before landing, and enables workflows where someone else reviews the PR first.

**Context:** `/ship` creates the PR. `/merge` would: check dashboard → run `/review` if needed → `gh pr merge`. This is where code review tracking belongs — at merge time, not at plan time.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Ship Confidence Dashboard (shipped)

## Completeness

### Completeness metrics dashboard

**What:** Track how often Claude chooses the complete option vs shortcut across gstack sessions. Aggregate into a dashboard showing completeness trend over time.

**Why:** Without measurement, we can't know if the Completeness Principle is working. Could surface patterns (e.g., certain skills still bias toward shortcuts).

**Context:** Would require logging choices (e.g., append to a JSONL file when AskUserQuestion resolves), parsing them, and displaying trends. Similar pattern to eval persistence.

**Effort:** M (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Boil the Lake shipped (v0.6.1)

## Safety & Observability

### On-demand hook skills (/careful, /freeze, /guard) — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Three new skills that use Claude Code's session-scoped PreToolUse hooks to add safety guardrails on demand.~~

Shipped as `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, and `/unfreeze` in v0.6.5. Includes hook fire-rate telemetry (pattern name only, no command content) and inline skill activation telemetry.

### Skill usage telemetry — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Track which skills get invoked, how often, from which repo.~~

Shipped in v0.6.5. TemplateContext in gen-skill-docs.ts bakes skill name into preamble telemetry line. Analytics CLI (`bun run analytics`) for querying. /retro integration shows skills-used-this-week.

### /investigate scoped debugging enhancements (gated on telemetry)

**What:** Six enhancements to /investigate auto-freeze, contingent on telemetry showing the freeze hook actually fires in real debugging sessions.

**Why:** /investigate v0.7.1 auto-freezes edits to the module being debugged. If telemetry shows the hook fires often, these enhancements make the experience smarter. If it never fires, the problem wasn't real and these aren't worth building.

**Context:** All items are prose additions to `investigate/SKILL.md.tmpl`. No new scripts.

**Items:**
1. Stack trace auto-detection for freeze directory (parse deepest app frame)
2. Freeze boundary widening (ask to widen instead of hard-block when hitting boundary)
3. Post-fix auto-unfreeze + full test suite run
4. Debug instrumentation cleanup (tag with DEBUG-TEMP, remove before commit)
5. Debug session persistence (~/.gstack/investigate-sessions/ — save investigation for reuse)
6. Investigation timeline in debug report (hypothesis log with timing)

**Effort:** M (all 6 combined)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Telemetry data showing freeze hook fires in real /investigate sessions
